# Description

This is a simple application that demonstrate the power of rest API, tableView and collectionView. 
Firstly, I want to acknowledge that the project is inspired by Amazon's kindle app and guided by Brian Voong through his application methodology -- No storyboard and programming approach.

## Lessons

* Principle of MVC programming approach 
* Basics of UITableViewController  and UICollectionViewController
* Anchoring of UIView instance to parent view.
* Connection between Model to Controllers and View and Controllers.
* Computed Properties and stored properties
